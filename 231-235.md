# 231.判断一个int数是否是2的倍数

如果某个int数是2的倍数，则在二进制的情况下，所有位里有且只有一位是1b，因此遍历数字的每一位，如果遇到某位为1b，如果去掉这一位数后，数字变成0，则该数字是2的倍数；否则，不是

```
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        while (n != 0) {
            int bit = n & 1;
            n = n >>> 1;
            if (bit == 1 && n != 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

# 232.利用栈结构实现队列
1. 加入新数字：将该元素压入栈
2. 弹出队列首元素：新建数组nums依次保存栈弹出的全部元素，将数组末尾的元素返回，并将数组内其余元素倒序压入栈中
3. 查看队列首元素：新建数组nums依次保存栈弹出的全部元素，将数组末尾的元素返回，并将数组内所有元素倒序压入栈中
4. 判断数组是否为空：调用栈函数isEmpty()
```
    Stack<Integer> stack;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        stack = new Stack<Integer>();
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        stack.push(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        int[] nums = new int[stack.size()];
        int i = -1;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = stack.pop();
        }
        int ret = nums[i];
        i--;
        while (i >= 0) {
            stack.push(nums[i]);
            i--;
        }
        return ret;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        int[] nums = new int[stack.size()];
        int i = -1;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = stack.pop();
        }
        int ret = nums[i];
        while (i >= 0) {
            stack.push(nums[i]);
            i--;
        }
        return ret;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
```

# 233.给定某个int数n，计算在小于等于n的所有非负数里数字1出现的所有次数，如n=13，则结果为6（1，10，11，12，13）

Let's start by counting the ones for every 10 numbers...

0, 1, 2, 3 ... 9 (1)

10, 11, 12, 13 ... 19 (1) + 10

20, 21, 22, 23 ... 29 (1)

...

90, 91, 92, 93 ... 99 (1)

100, 101, 102, 103 ... 109 (10 + 1)

110, 111, 112, 113 ... 119 (10 + 1) + 10

120, 121, 122, 123 ... 129 (10 + 1)

...

190, 191, 192, 193 ... 199 (10 + 1)

1)If we don't look at those special rows (start with 10, 110 etc), we know that there's a one at ones' place in every 10 numbers, there are 10 ones at tens' place in every 100 numbers, and 100 ones at hundreds' place in every 1000 numbers, so on and so forth.

Ok, let's start with ones' place and count how many ones at this place, set k = 1, as mentioned above, there's a one at ones' place in every 10 numbers, so how many 10 numbers do we have?

The answer is (n / k) / 10.

Now let's count the ones in tens' place, set k = 10, as mentioned above, there are 10 ones at tens' place in every 100 numbers, so how many 100 numbers do we have?

The answer is (n / k) / 10, and the number of ones at ten's place is (n / k) / 10 * k.

Let r = n / k, now we have a formula to count the ones at k's place: r / 10 * k

2)So far, everything looks good, but we need to fix those special rows, how?

We can use the mod. Take 10, 11, and 12 for example, if n is 10, we get (n / 1) / 10 * 1 = 1 ones at ones's place, perfect, but for tens' place, we get (n / 10) / 10 * 10 = 0, that's not right, there should be a one at tens' place! Calm down, from 10 to 19, we always have a one at tens's place, let m = n % k, the number of ones at this special place is m + 1, so let's fix the formula to be:

r / 10 * k + (r % 10 == 1 ? m + 1 : 0)

3)Wait, how about 20, 21 and 22?

Let's say 20, use the above formula we get 0 ones at tens' place, but it should be 10! How to fix it? We know that once the digit is larger than 2, we should add 10 more ones to the tens' place, a clever way to fix is to add 8 to r, so our final formula is:

(r + 8) / 10 * k + (r % 10 == 1 ? m + 1 : 0)

As you can see, it's all about how we fix the formula. Really hope that makes sense to you.

```
    public int countDigitOne(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (long k = 1; k <= n; k *= 10) {
            long r = n / k, m = n - r * k;
            res += (r + 8) / 10 * k + (r % 10 == 1 ? m + 1 : 0);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
